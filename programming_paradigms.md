Five Different Programming Paradigms are;
1. Imperative Programming
Imperative programming focuses on how a program operates. It uses statements that change a program’s state through direct commands.

Key Features: 

Step-by-step instructions.

Uses loops, conditionals, and variables.

Examples: C, Python (in its imperative style), Java.

2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
OOP organizes code around objects and classes, which model real-world entities with data (attributes) and behaviors (methods).

Key Features:

Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Encourages code reuse and modularity.

Examples: Java, C++, Python, Ruby.

3. Functional Programming
Emphasizes the use of pure functions and immutability. It avoids changing state and mutable data.

Key Features:

First-class functions and higher-order functions.

Recursion instead of loops.

Examples: Haskell, Lisp, Scala, Elixir.

4. Logic Programming
Based on formal logic, programs are written as a set of facts and rules. Computation is performed through inference.

Key Features:

Declarative nature — describes what to solve, not how.

Commonly used in AI and knowledge-based systems.

Examples: Prolog, Datalog.

5. Declarative Programming
Focuses on what the program should accomplish without specifying how to achieve it.

Key Features:

Emphasizes expressions and declarations.

Common in domain-specific languages.

Examples: SQL, HTML, CSS.
